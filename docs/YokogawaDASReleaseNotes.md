Yokogawa\_DAS Release Notes
===========================

Release 2-0-0
-------------

This release adds support for the Yokogawa GM10 Digital Acquisition
System. Support is included for all modules, except for the PID one
GX90UT-02-11. It does not allow for the chaining of expansion units.

Release 1-0-0
-------------

This is the first release of the synApps Yokogawa\_DAS module, where DAS
stands for Data Acquisition Systems. There are two models that are to be
supported, being the older MW100 and the newer GM10. Currently, only the
MW100 is supported by this module.

The support was developed using EPICS base 3.14.12, but earlier 3.14
releases should work.
